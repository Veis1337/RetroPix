## Description

My motivation for building this project originally was to create a user-friendly pixel-art drawing app so that I could design logos for my other apps in the style that I wanted. I quickly broadened my scope, realizing that this could be a really cool new take on social media by creating a localized platform with "lounges" for users to interact digitally while being in the same place physically. Bars, events, restaurants, businesses, you name it -- RetroPix is a beginner-friendly way to express yourself creatively.
As an introvert that also enjoys trying to be a little extroverted from time to time, this app drives a purpose I can get behind.
The drawing grid offers 3 different sizes, with beginner-friendly 15 pixel by 15 pixel being the default standard. 25x25 and 50x50 are available for more experienced creators that want to strut their stuff.
I learned a lot about the versatility of React's hooks building this project, as well as finding creative ways to use data structures and algorithms to manage API data.
